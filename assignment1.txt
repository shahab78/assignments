Gents, for the first assignment, we are going to combine a bunch of linked lists into one. 

The input of the function is going to be an array, which contains heads of multiple linked lists, 
the output is going to be a pointer, to the head of a linked list that has elements of all those 
linked lists in the input. 

Example: 

A: 1 -> 5 -> 9 -> 10

B: 2 -> 7 -> 8 -> 1

result = Combine (A&, B&)

result : 1 -> 2 -> 5 -> 9 -> 10 -> 7 -> 8 -> 1 (order of the elements doesn't matter)

You can have a class for the nodes, and another one for the linked lists, type and format of the objects
is your call.
